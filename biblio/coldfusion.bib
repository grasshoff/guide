  abstract = {Since 1989 the announcement of ``cold fusion'' by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleishmann, ``cold fusion'' field has been surrounded by controversy. After three decades, this field is alive and has produced thousands of publications, most in dedicated periodic and conferences. This work aims at checking whether ``cold fusion'' fits in pathological science traits. For each type of experiment and year, this work counted the distinct research groups results (success or failure). Experimental results from many research groups suggest that nuclear reactions in solids are more complex than fusion (it is not only fusion) and that they need energy triggers like background radiation, meaning chemical configurations alone do not seem to generate nuclear reactions. Some types of experiments present rising trends (the field does not fit in pathological science model) and have potential to bring disruptive technologies. If confirmed, experimental results will require revisions of accepted nuclear models.},

The detector system is equipped with an automated sample changer and three photomultiplier tubes, which makes the application of the triple-to-double coincidence ratio (TDCR) method possible. After decay correction, the measured decay rates were found to be stable and no annual oscillation could be observed. Thus, the findings of this work are in strong contradiction to those of Parkhomov [1] who reported on annual oscillations when measuring 90Sr/90Y with a Geiger-M\"uller counter. Sturrock et al. [2] carried out a more detailed analysis of the experimental data from Parkhomov and claimed to have found correlations between the decay rates and processes inside the Sun. These findings are questionable, since they are based on inappropriate experimental data as is demonstrated in this work. A frequency analysis of our activity data does not show any significant periodicity.},

  abstract = {Big science'' has prompted scientific collaboration, ultimately leading to multidisciplinary, co-operative science. This has paved the way for organizational ``champions'', leading experts with the ability of driving organizational change. This study investigates the involvement of how ``champions'' contributed to the rapid failures of the 1980s case of the cold fusion initiative NCFI in Utah, and the 2000s case of BBMRI.se, the Swedish node of a biobank harmonization initiative, and how these two examples would become ``failed scientific megaprojects''. This descriptive comparative case study has utilized available literature and documents covering the two megaprojects, with some supplemental interviews. The study shows that ``champions'' indeed enable research but simultaneously also risk becoming the downfall of the collaborative endeavors that have been set up. Moreover, this study has been able to uncover and analyze some of the most common types of organizational failure found in the two failed scientific megaprojects investigated. The common lesson inferred from both cases is that the unquestionable trust placed into some of the ``champions'' led to a lack of procedural transparency and professional candidness, ultimately leading to a loss of trust from their respective funding bodies.},

  abstract = {Debates about the management of scientific information have traditionally assumed that information is generated first in scientific laboratories or field sites, becomes ``real'' or stable when it appears in peer-reviewed journals, and is then further disseminated through textbooks, encyclopedias, trade journals, government reports, mass media stories, and the like. Classic texts\textemdash from the proceedings of the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference and the 1958 International Conference on Scientific Information, through such modern texts as the annual proceedings of ASIS meetings\textemdash focus on how to classify and retrieve ``real'' scientific information, that is, how to retrieve laboratory and field reports that have been produced for and vetted by the peer review system. In this paper I use the cold fusion saga of the late 1980s and early 1990s to suggest that communication among scientists uses many more media than traditionally have been assumed. This particular historical episode suggests that we need to develop new models of the science information process, ones that account for permeable boundaries between formal publications, preprints, electronic computer networks, fax machines, mass media presentations, and other forums for scientific discussions.},

Eisenhart's paper in Science called for statistically meaningful numbers, and Currie's Analytical Chemistry paper revealed the wide range in common definitions of detection limit. Confusion and worse can result when uncertainties are misinterpreted or ignored. The recent stories of cold fusion, variable radioactive decay, and piezonuclear reactions provide cautionary examples in which prior probability has been neglected. We show examples from our laboratory and others to illustrate the fact that uncertainty depends on both statistical and scientific judgment.},
