  abstract = {Using a substantial set of vagrancy removal records for Middlesex (1777-86) giving details of the place of origin of some 11,500 individuals, and analysing these records using a five variable gravity model of migration, this article addresses a simple question: from which parts of England did London draw its lower class migrants in the late eighteenth century? It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the North emerged as a competitor for potential migrants – contributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the West Midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. And third, that for the counties within about 130 kilometers of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.},

The model addresses factors that make locations attractive for trade and settlement, affecting settlement growth and change. We explore why some sites become relatively major settlements, while others diminish in the periods discussed. We assess how political and geographic constraints affect regional settlement transformations, while also accounting for uncertainty in the archaeological data. Model outputs indicate how the MBA settlement pattern contrasts from the IA for the same region when different factors affecting settlement size importance, facility of movement, and exogenous site interactions are studied. The results suggest the importance of political and historical factors in these periods and also demonstrate the value of a quantitative model in explaining emergent settlement size distributions across landscapes affected by different socio-environmental causal elements.},

For generations, there were intense family relations between the courts of the great kings, in whose self-presentation a hybridization was established. Accordingly, elements of Akhenaten‘s revolution should be seen as an engagement with trends from the Ancient Near East: the construction of a royal residential city and the creation of the non-anthopomorphic sun-disc with arms as a new deity.},

  abstract = {Regular celestial events assumed remarkable significance for the cultic rituals of the Hittite civilisation (c. 1600–1180 BC) in central Asia Minor. Numerous texts found at the capital Ḫattuša relate to solar deities and celestial divination reminiscent of Old Babylonian astronomical and astrological practices. Here we suggest that the rock sanctuary of Yazılıkaya, which was considered one of the holiest places in the Hittite kingdom, had a calendrical function. It contains more than 90 rock-cut reliefs, dating to the second half of the thirteenth century BC, of deities, humans, animals and mythical figures. The reliefs in Chamber A are arranged in groups to mark the days, synodic months and solar years. Using this system, the Hittite priests were able to determine when additional months were required to keep lunar and solar years aligned. The astronomical and astrological interpretation of Yazılıkaya serves as a point of departure for a brief re-examination of celestial aspects in Hittite religion.},
